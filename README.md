### Overview

This is a collection of my global dotfiles which remain same across my different machines. Rather than overriding the existing dotfiles files in the machine, it creates references in the existing dotfiles to these global files.

### Requirements

The dotfile for emacs is for version 24 of emacs
Installation script requires python2.6+ with docopt package

### Installation

Clone the repo and run the install.py script::

      git clone https://github.com/sharjeel/dotfiles.git
      cd dotfiles
      python install.py --all
